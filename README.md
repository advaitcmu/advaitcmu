# 👋 Hi, I’m Advait Kamathe  

🚀 **Master’s Student @ Carnegie Mellon (MISM)**  
💻 **Software Engineer | Backend & Cloud Enthusiast**  
📚 **Researcher in Machine Learning & Computer Vision**  

---

### 🌟 About Me  
- Built and scaled **patient scheduling systems** in healthcare tech (think *millions of bookings, secure APIs, and AWS magic*).  
- Love working with **Java, Spring Boot, AWS, Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL**.  
- Fascinated by **event-driven architectures** and making distributed systems talk to each other seamlessly.  

---

### 🔬 Research Adventures  
- 🧠 **EEG Action Classification** – Taught machines to read brain signals (walking vs sitting) → paving the way for smarter prosthetics.  
- 🚦 **Pedestrian Signal Detection** – Created a vision system to guide visually impaired individuals across busy streets.  

Both projects turned into **published papers in Springer**, which was a pretty cool ride.  

---

### ⚡ What I’m Up To  
- Leveling up in **cloud-native systems** & **serverless architectures**.  
- Pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems Management at CMU 🎓.  
- Building side projects that mix **practical APIs** with **fun experiments in AI**.

💡 *“I like building things that work at scale — whether it’s APIs handling millions of requests or models learning from brainwaves.”*
